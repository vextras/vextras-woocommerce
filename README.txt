Vextras is a must-have plugin for any WooCommerce store that wants to drive sales, stay organized and help their customers.

**Workflows**

Trigger abandoned cart emails, first-time buyer rewards, customer reminders, order status updates and more from our pre-built [workflows](https://www.vextras.com/workflows). Target your customers when it matters the most in one simple, easy-to-use rule builder.

= What subscription plan should I choose? =

Pick a subscription plan that fits your average monthly order volume. Don’t worry, you may adjust this anytime as your business needs change or simply enable [auto-scale pricing](https://www.vextras.com/docs/vextras-account-information/#subscriptions).

= What happens if I reach my order limit? =

If you reach your order limit before a billing cycle completes, your account will be paused unless you have auto-scale pricing enabled. You may upgrade your account to a plan that fits your needs at anytime. We will synchronize the data from the time it was paused to the current date on plan renewal.

= Is my data secure? =

We implement state-of-the-art security measures to maintain the safety of your store information. We use SSL technology that is encrypted to the 3rd parties that our services use. Sensitive information like credit cards, social security numbers, financials are not stored on our servers.

= Do canceled orders count towards my totals? =

No. If you have canceled orders in your store before they are successfully processed, they will not count against your monthly allotment on any subscription plan.

= Can I change plans? =

Yes. You can change plans anytime in your account ‘Plans’ area. Billing for upgrades will prorate based on your current billing cycle. Unfortunately, we do not offer partial credit for account downgrades or cancellations.

No. Whether you use tool or all of them, you’ll pay the same. So make the most of it!
